## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Zig 0.15.1 or later** - [Installation Guide](https://ziglang.org/download/)
- **Git** - For version control
- **A text editor** - VS Code with Zig extension recommended

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
   cd REPO_NAME
   ```
3. Add upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/REPO_NAME.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Build the Project

```bash
zig build
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
zig build test --summary all

# Check for memory leaks
zig build test 2>&1 | grep -i leak
```

### Format Code

```bash
# Format all Zig files
zig fmt src/

# Check formatting without modifying
zig fmt --check src/
```

## How to Contribute

### Important: Issue and PR Policy

**Issues:**
- **Only organization members can open issues**
- If you've found a bug or want to suggest a feature:
  1. Open a [Discussion](../../discussions) describing the problem or idea
  2. An organization member will review it
  3. If appropriate, a member will create an issue referencing your discussion

**Pull Requests:**
- **Pull requests can only be opened if they fix an existing issue**
- Each PR must reference the issue it fixes (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- PRs without a linked issue will be closed
- Workflow:
  1. Find an open issue or start a discussion to get one created
  2. Comment on the issue to express interest in working on it
  3. Wait for assignment or approval from maintainers
  4. Create your PR that references the issue

### Starting a Discussion

To report bugs, suggest features, or ask questions:

1. Go to the [Discussions](../../discussions) tab
2. Click "New discussion"
3. Choose the appropriate category:
   - **Bug Reports** - For reporting bugs
   - **Feature Requests** - For suggesting new features
   - **Q&A** - For questions about usage or implementation
4. Provide detailed information:
   - **For bugs:**
     - Clear description of the bug
     - Steps to reproduce
     - Expected vs actual behavior
     - Zig version and OS
     - Minimal reproduction code
   - **For features:**
     - Clear description of the feature
     - Use case and motivation
     - Proposed API
   - **For questions:**
     - What you're trying to accomplish
     - What you've already tried
     - Relevant code samples
5. A maintainer will review and create an issue if needed

## Coding Guidelines

### Zig Style

Follow standard Zig conventions:

```zig
// Good: snake_case for functions and variables
pub fn processData(input: []const u8) !void {
    const result = try parseInput(input);
    return result;
}

// Good: PascalCase for types
pub const MyType = struct {
    value: i32,
    data: []const u8,
};

// Good: SCREAMING_CASE for constants
const MAX_SIZE: usize = 1000;
```

### Documentation

All public APIs must be documented:

```zig
/// Creates a new instance with the specified configuration.
///
/// Memory: Caller must call deinit() when done.
/// Returns: A new instance with ref_count = 1
/// Errors: OutOfMemory if allocation fails
pub fn init(allocator: Allocator, config: Config) !*Self {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Memory Management

Follow these patterns:

```zig
// Objects with deinit
const obj = try Object.init(allocator);
defer obj.deinit();

// Owned return values
const str = try obj.toString(allocator);
defer allocator.free(str); // Caller owns result
```

### Error Handling

Use Zig's error handling:

```zig
// Define specific errors
pub const MyError = error{
    InvalidInput,
    NotFound,
    OutOfBounds,
};

// Return errors
pub fn process(input: []const u8) MyError!void {
    if (input.len == 0) {
        return error.InvalidInput;
    }
    // ...
}

// Handle errors
const result = process(data) catch |err| {
    std.debug.print("Error: {}\n", .{err});
    return err;
};
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```zig
test "Feature name - specific scenario" {
    const allocator = std.testing.allocator;
    
    // Setup
    const obj = try MyType.init(allocator);
    defer obj.deinit();
    
    // Execute
    const result = try obj.process();
    
    // Assert
    try std.testing.expectEqual(expected, result);
    
    // Cleanup happens via defer
}
```

### Test Coverage

All new features must include:

- ‚úÖ **Happy path tests** - Normal usage scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Edge case tests** - Boundary conditions
- ‚úÖ **Error tests** - Invalid inputs and error conditions
- ‚úÖ **Memory tests** - No leaks via `defer` patterns

### Test Naming

Use descriptive test names:

```zig
// Good
test "MyType.process - handles empty input" { }
test "MyType.process - processes multiple items correctly" { }
test "MyType.process - returns error on invalid data" { }

// Bad
test "process test" { }
test "test1" { }
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Starting

1. **Find or create an issue**
   - Browse [open issues](../../issues)
   - Or start a [discussion](../../discussions) to get an issue created by a maintainer
   - Comment on the issue to express interest
   - Wait for maintainer approval/assignment before starting work

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/123-issue-description
   # Example: git checkout -b fix/123-memory-leak
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Follow coding guidelines above
   - Add tests for new features or fixes
   - Update documentation as needed

4. **Run quality checks**
   ```bash
   # Format code
   zig fmt src/
   
   # Run all tests
   zig build test --summary all
   
   # Verify no memory leaks
   zig build test 2>&1 | grep -i leak
   
   # Build in release mode
   zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in process() (fixes #123)"
   ```
   
   Use conventional commits:
   - `fix:` - Bug fix (most common for PRs)
   - `feat:` - New feature
   - `docs:` - Documentation only
   - `test:` - Adding tests
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `perf:` - Performance improvement

6. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin fix/123-issue-description
   ```

### Creating the PR

1. Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request
2. **REQUIRED:** Reference the issue in the title or description
   - Use "Fixes #123" or "Closes #123" in the PR description
   - This will automatically close the issue when merged
   - Example title: "fix: resolve memory leak in process()"
   - Example description: "Fixes #123 by ensuring proper cleanup..."
3. Fill out the PR template completely
4. Ensure all CI checks pass
5. Wait for maintainer review

**‚ö†Ô∏è PRs without a linked issue will be closed immediately.**

### PR Review Process

- Maintainers will review your PR within a few days
- Address feedback by pushing new commits to the same branch
- Once approved, maintainers will merge your PR
- Your contribution will be credited in release notes

## Questions?

- **All questions, bugs, and feature ideas** - Start a [Discussion](../../discussions)
- **Contributing to an existing issue** - Comment on the issue
- **General help** - Use the Q&A category in Discussions

**Remember:** Only organization members can open issues. Always start with a discussion!
