# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation that is no longer actively maintained or has been superseded.

## Why These Were Archived

**AUTOMATIC_BUILD_CODEGEN.md**
- Described old `build_impl.zig` helper approach
- That implementation was removed (didn't work)
- See `CONSUMER_USAGE.md` for current integration pattern

**CRITICAL_ISSUES.md**
- Planning document from development phase
- Issues described have been resolved
- See main README.md for current status

**CROSS_FILE_DESIGN.md**
- Design document for cross-file inheritance feature
- Feature is now implemented and working
- See IMPLEMENTATION.md for current architecture

**LIBRARY_USAGE.md**
- Redundant with CONSUMER_USAGE.md
- CONSUMER_USAGE.md is more complete and up-to-date

**plan.md**
- Original vision/design document
- Current implementation differs significantly
- See IMPLEMENTATION.md for actual architecture

**PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**
- Basic directory listing
- Obvious from file system structure
- Minimal value

**REMAINING_ISSUES.md**
- Planning document listing TODOs
- Most issues resolved
- See README.md for current status

**TEST_SUMMARY.md**
- Test summary documentation
- Redundant with tests/README.md
- Test output speaks for itself

**TESTING.md**
- Minimal test documentation
- See tests/README.md instead
- Test files are self-documenting

## Current Documentation

For current, maintained documentation, see the project root:

- **README.md** - Main documentation, quick start, features
- **CONSUMER_USAGE.md** - Complete integration guide for users
- **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Architecture and how it works
- **API_REFERENCE.md** - API documentation
